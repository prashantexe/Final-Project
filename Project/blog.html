            <h2>Our Certificates & online Programs For 2022</h2>
            <p>The Students' Placement Office (SPO), IIT Kanpur is maintained and managed by a dedicated team of office staff and students who are responsible for all areas of IIT Kanpur placements. The SPO team assists recruiters to the best of its ability. We are grateful for the trust placed in us by various organisations, and we hope to continue working with them in the future.
</p><br>
                <p>I would like to warmly welcome all the current and prospective recruiters to the Student Placement Office (SPO) of IIT Kanpur. In this age, demanding continual technology enhancements, the industry requires talented youngsters with outstanding analytical skills, open mindset and innovative approach towards problem solving. I am glad to convey that IIT Kanpur is home to such bright young minds. Our next batch of students is all set to graduate soon and they are looking for opportunities that are appealing to their intellect and would help them realize their full potential.<br>

<p>At IIT Kanpur, we make every effort to hone the technical and analytical skills of our students through the rigorous coursework that focusses on up-to-date scientific knowledge and state-of-the-art technological know-hows in their respective disciplines. </p><p>The UG curriculum of each department consists of certain compulsory courses on the institute level, core courses on the departmental level, departmental electives and open electives. The inclusion of open electives, wherein the students can opt for elective courses from any department, adds interdisciplinary component to the curriculum.</p> <br><p>In addition, each student is also required to take certain minimum course-credits in the department of Humanities and Social Sciences which greatly enhances their outlook towards the society and its needs. Our PG students, who are admitted at IITK after a very tough entrance procedure, undergo rigorous coursework consisting of advanced level courses. As the most essential part of their degree, they write their theses under the able supervision of our faculty who themselves are renowned researchers in their respective fields.
